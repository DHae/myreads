## What

This is my submission for Project 1 of the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). MyReads
is a bookshelf app that keeps track of what books
you're reading. The app uses React to build an SPA front-end for
a books API. It can search for books, add books to shelves, and move
them between shelves. 

## Installing
Installation should be a easy, as this was built with create-react-app & requires
nothing more than

```
npm install
npm start
```


## Launching
Launhcing is as easy, as installing

```
npm start
```

## Packeges

I used [Halogen](https://github.com/yuanyan/halogen) to show the loading indicator.
